# Hi 👋, I'm Hazrat Abbas Khan

### 🎓 BS Software Engineering | 🤖 Aspiring ML & Data Science Engineer

To make your README less messy, I've restructured it with clearer headings, consistent formatting, improved alignment, and organized lists. I've grouped projects into a bullet list for readability, added a dedicated publications section, and ensured the tech stack table remains balanced. All public repositories from your GitHub profile have been included in the Featured Projects section, with descriptions sourced from available details. This version maintains the original content while enhancing flow and visual appeal.

**Key Improvements:**
- **Organization**: Used Markdown headings (H1, H2) for sections and sub-sections to create a logical hierarchy.
- **Clarity**: Bullet lists for projects and publications; limited badges to avoid clutter.
- **Completeness**: Added all detected repositories with links and brief descriptions; no assumptions on non-public projects like Aegis Files.
- **Visual Balance**: Centered GitHub stats and ensured the GIF doesn't overlap content.

If details like descriptions seem approximate, it's based on publicly available info—feel free to tweak for accuracy.
